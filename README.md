INTRODUCTION
The analysis of political campaign contributions is a critical component in understanding the dynamics of political campaigns and the funding sources behind them. One of the primary challenges of analyzing political contributions is the sheer volume of data generated over time. To effectively manage and analyze this data, a data warehouse project is required. 
The project will involve the consolidation of data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing websites, into a centralized data warehouse. With this data, analytical queries can performed to examine the patterns of contributions over time, identify trends in donor behavior, and assess the impact of various events on the election cycle. 
By utilizing data warehousing techniques, data can be effectively stored and large volumes of data can analyzed, providing insights into the funding sources of political campaigns and the impact of contributions on the political process.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to effectively implement and compare the two types of large-scale databases: Data Warehouses for dimensional data and Hadoop systems for Distributed data.
